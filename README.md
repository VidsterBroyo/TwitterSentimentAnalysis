# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
A machine learning model trained on a dataset of 1.6 million tweets to predict a Tweetâ€™s sentiment. 2 models trained using Random Forest and XGBoost.

Due to GitHub's 100 MB file limit, I can't upload the dataset. However, here it is on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140/data.
